# JsWhole30Diet
Lovingly named after the Whole 30 Diet I've heard people going on. ...It was the first thing I thought of when I heard about the JavaScript 30 Challenge.

This is my work for going through the JavaScript30 Challenge.

A friend of mine is going through this. I both wanted to be able to help, should she get stuck, and I know I could use some brushing up on Js.

In many of these I've tried to do a little bit extra to make it my own, or tinker with the exercises outside the realm of the exact exercise.

As I've completed the exercises, I've removed the prompt files. This is for ease of viewing, for myself.
